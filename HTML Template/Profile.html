            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a software engineer with an interest in projects that promote sustainability, social equity, and
                inclusive innovation. I am currently working towards a Level 4 Software Development apprenticeship.
                <br>I am currently working for Sainsbury's within the backend Pricing & Promotions team. Our team works
                within the Commercial Data Services department to help provide our customers with accurate and legal
                product and pricing information. </p>

            <h2>Ways I Prefer to Communicate</h2>
            <p>I highly value clear, direct communication at work. I find that I perform best when expectations and
                goals are laid out plainly. I am available to contact on Slack, Teams, and Outlook. I appreciate Teams
                calls where I can ask lots of questions, especially at this point early on in my career.
                Please find my contact details and preferences below.</p>

            <h2>Ways of Working</h2>
            <p>At Sainsbury's, we practice a smarter, flexible way of working. This means that my working hours could
                differ week to week, however, I make an effort to attend all live meetings when possible as this gives
                me the opportunity to get answers to my questions quickly. Often, when in meetings with more
                knowledgeable team members, I request that we record the meeting so that I can re-watch it at a later
                date to make notes.

            <h2>Experience and Professional Development</h2>
            <p>Although I have only been working in tech since Jan '25, I have had a keen interest in programming for
                many years. I was first exposed to coding during my Physics degree at The University of Manchester,
                where I used Python for data analysis as part of many project, include a project that recreated results
                found by the LHCb experiment at CERN.
                Since graduation, I have explored full-stack development and have a particular interest in back-end.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of work, I love doing creative activities that help me stay away from screens and allow me to
                switch off. My favourite activites include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pottery</b> - I have most experience hand-building, but have recently started throwing using a
                    wheel.
                </li>
                <li><b>Textile Arts</b> - Specifically knitting, crochet, tunisian crochet and sewing. I love being able
                    to avoid fast-fashion by making my own clothes.
                </li>
                <li><b>Reading</b> - I love reading novels that delve into complex human relationships, however, the
                    next book on my list is 'The New Age of Sexism' by Laura Bates which is about 'How the AI Revolution
                    is Reinventing Misogyny'.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cooking</b> - To help me unwind after a day of work, I love to cook new recipes to enjoy with
                    friends and family. Recently, I have been trying recipes from the cookbook 'Kin: Caribbean Recipes
                    for the Modern Kitchen' by Marie Mitchell.
