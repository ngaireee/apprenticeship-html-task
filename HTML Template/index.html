            <p>Welcome to the Software Developer Level 4 Course!</p>
            <p>
                Over the duration of the program, you will learn about coding best practices, software design principles, and the theory of these principles, backed up with a learning plan so you can develop in a language of your choosing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This task is part of your work with the induction team and will give you an opportunity to do some self-guided HTML learning while meeting some of the course criteria. 
                You are encouraged to be as creative as you like, as we want to get to know you through your work.
            </p>
