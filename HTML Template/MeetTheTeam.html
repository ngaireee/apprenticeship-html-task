                    <h2>Sam Osborne</h2>
                    <p><strong>Role: </strong>Business Coach</p>
                    <p><strong>Bio: </strong> Hello! I'm Sam and I'm the Software Development coach at JustIT. Being a coach has allowed me to merge my passions for software development and people development. I have worked as a developer in both the public and private sector. I love to cook, travel and spend time in the pub! I spend most of my time lazing around with my dogs, Winston and Reggie. I'm a huge advocate for education for all, no matter your gender, race, sexuality or socioeconomic status, especially in STEM subjects.</p>

                            <li>I love meeting new people and forming relationships. It's the reason I love my job so much!</li>
                            <li>I value honesty. I'll challenge your thoughts just as much as I'd expect you to challenge mine.</li>
                            <li>I'm super organised and super disoarganised all at the same time. I have tons of notes and todo lists and plans but I still always seem to forget something!</li>
                            <li>I'm all in and will do anything I can to help you succeed. I'll give you my full support and time, and I just ask for the same level of effort in return.</li>

                <p>I prefer open, informal communication. Feel free to reach out however works best for you, email, phone, Teams, or Slack. That said, I'm way quicker to respond on Teams and Slack, so if you want a speedy reply, that's where to find me! </p>
