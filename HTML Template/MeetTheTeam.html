                    <h2>Sam Osborne</h2>
                    <p><strong>Role: </strong>Business Coach</p>
                    <p><strong>Bio: </strong> Hello! I'm Sam and I'm the Software Development coach at JustIT. Being a coach has allowed me to merge my passions for software development and people development. I have worked as a developer in both the public and private sector. I love to cook, travel and spend time in the pub! I spend most of my time lazing around with my dogs, Winston and Reggie. I'm a huge advocate for education for all, no matter your gender, race, sexuality or socioeconomic status, especially in STEM subjects.</p>

                            <li>I love meeting new people and forming relationships. It's the reason I love my job so much!</li>

                            <li>I'm super organised and super disoarganised all at the same time. I have tons of notes and todo lists and plans but I still always seem to forget something!</li>
                            <li>I'm all in and will do anything I can to help you succeed. I'll give you my full support and time, and I just ask for the same level of effort in return.</li>
